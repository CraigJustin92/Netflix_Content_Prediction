# Netflix Content Prediction

This project explores predictive modeling for Netflix content acquisition and strategy. The goal is to develop models that accurately identify movies likely to be fast-added (added within the first year of release) to the platform.

## Introduction

In this project, I delve into the intricacies of machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making processes and drive strategic outcomes in collaboration with Netflix.

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop predictive models that streamline the content acquisition process, maximize the value of Netflix's content portfolio, and enhance the viewer experience.

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset for relevant features such as genre, release year, duration, etc. Gain insights into the characteristics of fast-added movies and identify potential predictor variables.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates.

3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Engineer new features and select the most relevant ones for predictive modeling, ensuring alignment with Netflix's strategic objectives.

4. **Hypothesis Testing using Chi-squared**: Conduct hypothesis testing using the chi-squared test to analyze associations between categorical variables, such as genre and fast-addition to the platform.

5. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Develop predictive models using several machine learning algorithms. Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **Model Interpretation and Insights**: Collaborate with Netflix's content acquisition and strategy teams to interpret model results and derive actionable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows).
